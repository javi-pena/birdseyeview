The goal of this 1.5-hour lecture is to give MSCF students a "bird's eye view" of optimization.  Students will get acquainted with some popular types of optimization models: linear, quadratic, and integer programming.  The lecture features "cvxpy" -- a popular and easy-to-use numerical optimization Python library.  The lecture includes some examples and exercises to give you some hands-on experience with these optimization models and tools.
