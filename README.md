The goal of these two 1.5-hour lectures is to give MSCF students a "bird's eye view" of optimization.  Students will get acquainted with some popular types of optimization models: linear, quadratic, and integer programming.  The lectures will feature two popular and easy-to-use numerical optimization tools: Excel "solver" and Python "cvxpy" library.  The lectures will include examples and exercises to give you some hands-on experience with these optimization models and tools.
